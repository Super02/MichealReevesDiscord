Hi, this is where I've uploaded some of my projects. My primary language is Java though right now I'm in love with Python. I'm currently making a bot in Python that is called "EmojiBot". Right now it does not have many features though I'm expanding it rapidly. I also have some of my Minecraft plugins as I also develop in Java.


## EmojiBot Source
My discord bot the "EmojiBot" is in the folder named: "[EmojiBot-py](EmojiBot-py)"


## OPtest Source
My first plugin named "OPtest" is in the folder named: "[RetreiveOP](RetreiveOP)" and can be viewed at spigot [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/optest.57024/)

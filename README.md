# MichealReevesDiscord
Hi, this is where I've uploaded some of my projects. My primary language is Java though right now I'm in love with Python. I'm currently making a bot in Python that is called "EmojiBot". Right now it does not have many features though I'm expanding it rapidly. I also have some of my Minecraft plugins as I also develop in Java.

My discord bot the "EmojiBot" is in the folder named: "EmojiBot-py"

My first plugin named "OPtest" is in the folder named: "RetreiveOP" and can be viewed at spigot (here)[https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/optest.57024/]

My second plugin named "Screenshare Advanced" is in the folder named: "Screenshare" and can be viewed at spigot (here)[https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/screenshare-advanced.60485/]: 

OPtest: OPtest is a plugin that allowes Staff to regain their OP ability by using a simple command ("/givemeop").
ScreenShare Advanced: ScreenShare Advanced is a highly customizable plugin that allowes staff to freeze and screenshare users on their server by using the command ("/freeze (User)")
